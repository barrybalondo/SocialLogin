Ruby on Rails Social Login

Goals
 - Use OmniAuth to implement login with different social media particularly TWitter, Facebook, Google+ and LinkedIn

Approach
 - Build different branches for each social media and hopefully merge them for a multi social login 

 Results
 - Success! Was able to implement twitter and facebook. I believe the same approach goes to google+ and linkedIn.
